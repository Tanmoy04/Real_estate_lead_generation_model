# Real_estate_lead_generation_model
Statistical modeling and machine learning for predicting lead behavior and property preferences in real estate using Python and Colab.

## Project Summary

This project focuses on analyzing and predicting customer behavior and preferences in the real estate domain. By applying statistical modeling, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and machine learning, it aims to improve lead targeting and property recommendations.

---

## Objective

To explore the behavior of real estate leads, uncover significant categorical relationships, and build predictive models to forecast property preferences and lead conversion likelihood.

##  Notebook Structure

1. **Step 2: EDA â€” Understanding the Dataset**

   * Missing value treatment
   * Feature categorization
   * Exploratory plots and summary statistics

2. **Step 3: Hypothesis Testing (Chi-Square Test)**

   * Statistical testing of categorical features to determine significance

3. **Step 4: Machine Learning Models**

   * **Decision Tree Classifier**: Initial classification approach
   * **Random Forest Classifier**: Improved ensemble model
   * **SMOTE**: Used to balance class distribution before retraining models

## Tools & Libraries Used

* Python 3.10+
* pandas
* numpy
* matplotlib, seaborn
* scikit-learn
* imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)

---

## Key Outcomes

* Performed EDA to understand lead behavior and property preference distribution
* Applied chi-square tests to validate hypotheses about categorical feature relationships
* Built classification models (Decision Tree, Random Forest)
* Enhanced model performance with SMOTE for balanced classification
